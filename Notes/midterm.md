# SDLC
## Phases
* Planning – resource allocation and management
* Requirements Specification – identifies necessary  features
* Design – architecture, modules, interfaces
* Development – implementation
* Testing – validation of correctness
* Documentation – describes product
* Maintenance – ongoing error correction
* Evolution – ongoing requirements changes

* Goal of Phases
    * Clarify steps to be performed
    * Produce tangible work products
    * Enable others to review work products
    * Specify next steps

## Stages of Software Development
![Stages of Software Developments](../images/StagesOfSoftwareDevelopment.png)
![Cost per Stage](../images/CostPerStage.png)


* Example: 
    * Relative cost of fixing errors at various stages  are:
        * Specification (3)
        * Design (5)
        * Implementation (50)
        * Maintenance – after deploy (300)
    * If cost to find and fix an error in design is $100, what are the costs for other stages?

## SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
### SDLC Methodologies
* Waterfall ![Waterfall](../images//WaterFall.png)
    * Linear-sequential life cycle model
    * Phases are dependent on each other
    * Teams are large
    * Can take several months or even years to complete

    * Requirement
        * Well understood and  stable requirements upfront
    * Advantage 
        * Easy to plan and staff
    * Disadvantage
        * Iterations are costly $$
        * Lack of feedback from customers



* V-Shape

* Prototyping
* Iterative
* Spiral
* Agile
    * Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP)
